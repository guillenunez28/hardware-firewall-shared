# Known Limitations with Hardware Firewall (Shared)

A Hardware Firewall (Shared) cannot be deployed to a server on a VLAN that meets any of the following criteria. 

* Is currently associated with a Network Gateway, Hardware Firewall, or FortiGate Security Appliance.
* Contains 30 or more servers.

In these instances, a new VLAN must be established for the Firewall or another product must be selected.

Further limitations for the Hardware Firewall (Shared) include: 

* Portable subnets are not protected
* Not available for 10Gb servers
* Maximum of 79 firewall rules per Hardware Firewall (Shared)
* Incompatible with Windows Network Load Balancing (NLB) due to the way ARP is processed
* The rule destination subnet is limited to the IP of the protected server.
