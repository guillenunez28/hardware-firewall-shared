# FAQs for Hardware Firewall (Shared)
The following are frequently asked questions when working with the Hardware Firewall (Shared).

## What is a firewall?
{:faq}

A firewall is a network device that is connected upstream from a server. The firewall blocks unwanted traffic from a server before the server is reached.

## Why should I use a firewall?
{:faq}

The primary advantage of having a firewall is that your server only has to handle “good” traffic – this means your resource is solely being used for its intended purpose as opposed to handling unwanted traffic, too.

## What firewall products does IBM© offer?
{:faq}

You can find a detailed comparison of all firewall products offered in the IBM© Cloud by reviewing this [topic](/docs/infrastructure/fortigate-10g?topic=fortigate-10g-exploring-firewalls). 

## Is the Hardware Firewall (Shared) compatible with IBM's load balancer products?
{:faq}

Yes. The Hardware Firewall (Shared) is compatible with the cloud load balancing service, local load balancer, as well as the Citrix Netscaler VPX and MPX.

## Can portable IP’s be protected by the Hardware Firewall (Shared)?
{:faq}

No. Portable IPs are not available for protection because they can be moved between servers. Exceptions are made on a case by case basis as there are numerous caveats and require additional details about the customer's system design.

## Can I have a Hardware Firewall and a Network Gateway associated with the same VLAN?
{:faq}

No, it is not possible to have a Hardware Firewall (Shared or Dedicated)  and a Network Gateway device assigned to the same VLAN.  The expanded functionality of the Network Gateway device provides firewall features for your network in place of a shared or dedicated firewall.

## Does public traffic pass through my load balancer or Hardware Firewall first?
{:faq}

Coming from the public internet in, the load balancing products are first, the Hardware Firewall products are next, and the NetScaler products are last (along with the customers servers).

## Does a server's uplink port speed need to match the Hardware Firewall (Shared)?
{:faq}

The Hardware Firewall (Shared) does need to match the public uplink speed of the server. However, because it only protects the public side of the network, the public uplink speed is what must match the firewall selection.  Customers can create a ticket to request a downgrade of only the public interfaces if desired.

## Does IBM Cloud charge for firewall bandwidth?
{:faq}

The Hardware Firewall (Shared), Hardware Firewall (Dedicated), and FortiGate Security Appliance (FSA) 1G are not metered for bandwidth.  FSA 10G is charged for firewall bandwidth after 20 TB are used. Additionally, these products can reduce total bandwidth utilization by limiting the traffic that servers must respond to.

## How do I upgrade the uplink of my Hardware Firewall (Shared)?
{:faq}

The Hardware Firewall (Shared) is locked to the public uplink port speed of a server. You can upgrade in place by cancelling the firewall, upgrading the port speed for the server, and ordering a new firewall. Alternatively, you can deploy a new server with the desired uplinks and associated firewall.

## Is High Availability possible with the Hardware Firewall (Shared)?
{:faq}

No. The Hardware Firewall platform is enterprise-grade and highly durable, but true High Availability (redundant devices) is not an option for the Hardware Firewall (Shared). For HA, a Hardware Firewall (Dedicated with High Availability) or FortiGate Security Appliance (High Availability) is required.  The Network Gateway product also has an HA option with firewall capabilities.

## I am running a hypervisor on an IBM Cloud server. Will the Hardware Firewall (Shared) protect the Virtual Machines running on my hypervisor?
{:faq}

No. Portable IPs are used for the VMs in a hypervisor environment and portable IPs are not protected by the shared hardware firewall.  A Hardware Firewall (Dedicated) or FortiGate Security Appliance is recommended.

## What are the grayed out ports in my Windows Firewall?
{:faq}

IBM Cloud offers many different services that you can utilize with your server including Evault, SNMP and Nagios monitoring. These services require that our internal systems communicate with your server to some degree. The grayed out ports you see in the Exceptions list are ports open on the internal network port only. They are still blocked on the public (internet) network connection. Since the internal network is a secured network having these ports open is considered secure.

These ports generally cannot be modified; however, if you reset the firewall rules, it will clear them from the Exceptions list. Please beware that resetting the firewall rules may have an adverse affect not only on these additional services but also could cause other issues as well with your server depending on its current configuration.

## What Hardware Firewall options are available for 10Gbps servers?
{:faq}

The only firewall offering that supports 10G is FSA 10G. To support 10Gbps public uplinks, a Network Gateway is required.  If 10Gbps is only required on the private network (for database, backup, storage, etc), then customers can request a downgrade of only their public uplinks and order any of the Hardware Firewall products.

## What IP ranges do I allow through the firewall?
{:faq}

For the list of IP addresses and IP ranges to allow through the firewall, go [here](/docs/infrastructure/hardware-firewall-dedicated?topic=hardware-firewall-dedicated-ibm-cloud-ip-ranges){: new_window}. 

## What VPN options are included with each Firewall product?
{:faq}

Not all firewalls offer VPN and not all VPN options are the same.  The general options for VPN are:

* Each customer receives unlimited SSL VPN connections to our private network. These connections can be established by clicking the VPN link at the top of the page while logged into the customer portal.
* Customers also receive one PPTP VPN per account. They can add additional PPTP VPN users to their account in packs of 5 for $5/month extra.
* SoftLayer also offers a basic multi-tenant IPSec VPN service starting at $99/month.
* The FortiGate Security Appliance 1G provides SSL and IPSec VPN options with Public network access only (no access to the SoftLayer private network). FSA 10G provides SSL and IPSec VPN options with Public or Private network access. 
* The Network Gateway provides SSL, IPSec and OpenVPN capabilities on the public or private network
* The NetScaler products can provide SSL and IPSec VPN on the public or private network.
* Customers can also deploy a VPN solution on to a server within their IBM Cloud environment.

## Which firewall products support public-to-private NAT and/or private VLAN segmentation?
{:faq}

Fortigate Security Appliance 10G supports NAT and private VLAN segmentation. The other firewall offerings only support public traffic.
